## Main idea of the project
This app was made to make people happier. Imagine you come home from work/school/university and you are very tired. You know how to goole so you can find all films online for free, but to know what to google, you need to choose a film first. And instead of reading bad, short reviews on random website you can just open the app with great UX and find film to watch, isn't that good idea?

## Where can I find build of application?
It will be published to [this website](https://anoobisthegod.github.io/site/megaunicorns/), there you can find latest build for the android<br>
IOS version is not available for now and also I don't know how will you install IOS build from website, so I will not publish it.

## How this works?
App gets data with api.dart file using [movieAPI](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
Then app reduces data into lists of objects and maps and shows it to user but wrapped in wigdgets
